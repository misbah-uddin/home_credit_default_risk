    "# Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Home Credit Group\n",
    "\n",
    "Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Home Credit is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, they're challenging Kagglers to help them unlock the full potential of their data. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful."

    "There are 7 different sources of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>application_train.csv</b>: contains the main training data with information about each loan application at Home Credit. Every loan has its own row and is identified by the feature `SK_ID_CURR`. The training application data comes with the `TARGET` indicating 0 (the loan was repaid) or 1 (the loan was not repaid). \n",
    "* <b>application_test.csv</b>: contains the main testing data with information about each loan application at Home Credit. Every loan has its own row and is identified by the feature `SK_ID_CURR`. \n",
    "* <b>bureau.csv</b>: contains data concerning client's previous credits from other financial institutions. Each previous credit has its own row in bureau, but one loan in the application data can have multiple previous credits.\n",
    "* <b>bureau_balance.csv</b>: contains monthly data about the previous credits in bureau. Each row is one month of a previous credit, and a single previous credit can have multiple rows, one for each month of the credit length. \n",
    "* <b>previous_application.csv</b>: contains previous applications for loans at Home Credit of clients who have loans in the application data. Each current loan in the application data can have multiple previous loans. Each previous application has one row and is identified by the feature `SK_ID_PREV`. \n",
    "* <b>POS_CASH_BALANCE.csv</b>: contains monthly data about previous point of sale or cash loans clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a previous point of sale or cash loan, and a single previous loan can have many rows.\n",
    "* <b>credit_card_balance.csv</b>: monthly data about previous credit cards clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a credit card balance, and a single credit card can have many rows.\n",
    "* <b>installments_payment.csv</b>: contains payment history for previous loans at Home Credit. There is one row for every made payment and one row for every missed payment. "
